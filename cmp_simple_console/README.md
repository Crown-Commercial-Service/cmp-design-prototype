# Example Journey

Prototype to prove

- CCS Front End Kit
- Agreement design repository approach


Approach is to copy the GOV.UK kit from npm, and overwrite
key elements using 

- text replace (hack)
- adding minimum source components to overwrite GOV.UK elements

This demonstrates we can use the GOV.UK kit with a minimum set of additions.


## Principles

- use GOV.UK style names -- don't rename everything 'govuk' to 'ccs' just for the sake of it 

## Build

- npm install
- gulp

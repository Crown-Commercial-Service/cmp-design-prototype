# Data model: Agreements
## ItemType
  Defines the items that can be offered in any selected agreements
Agreements hava a number of items that can have values defining the agreement. The Items should
constrain the key quantifiable elements of an agreement award. A supplier may provide additional
variable facts in their Offer to supplement the description of how they support the agreement.

|id|String|1|The code id, which must be unique across all schemes|

|uri|String|1| URI for the code within the scheme defining this type |
|code|String|1| Code within the scheme defining this type |
|unit|(Area,Commission,Currency)|1| define the units, if one units matches |
## ExpressionOfNeed
   Defines a buyer's need which can be matched to agreement items and other details
The need matches closely to our definitions of agreements under 'items types' and their classification
schemes, but is not a one-to-one match.

# Codes
## CCS 
CCS invented schemes

## Budget 
What is the budget the buyer has for their need?
Match the budget to the value range of the agreement, and the value range of supplier offers.
Matching the budget will probably require evaluation of offer prices.

## Location 
Where is the need?
Match location needs to locations of offers

## Service 
What sort of things do they need?
Match the service to item types, their keywords, and offering titles.

## Party
  
  The party is used to identify buyers and suppliers. Since some organisations act as

be one or the other. The onvolvement of the party with an agreement determine  the role in
that contenxt.

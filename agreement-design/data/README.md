# /Data

This folder is for raw _input_ files defining 

- catalogue (Offerings) 
- suppliers

These are converted into catalgue and related data in `gen/data` 
as examples of how catalogues can be loaded.

For more dynamic catalogues and supplier - agreement relationships
these Offerings will likely be updated directly through the
Agreement API the relevant databases and indexes.

As a demo, we load the generated data into a search index.

*Don't enter actual agreements here unless they are already published*
